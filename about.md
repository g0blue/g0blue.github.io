![profile picture](/images/benham_profile.jpg "Dan's ugly mug") I am a husband, father, mountain biker, sometimes runner, and graphics software engineer working for [Intel](https://www.intel.com). I'm not sure where this blog thing will go (if anywhere), but I thought I would take it for a spin.

Why doesn't the picture work?
